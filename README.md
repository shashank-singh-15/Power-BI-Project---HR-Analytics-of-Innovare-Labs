Data Exploration: Key measures, such as total employees, active/inactive employees, and attrition rate (16.1%), were calculated to understand workforce trends.
Visualization and Reporting: Dashboards were created to benchmark metrics against industry standards and analyze trends in hiring, performance, and employee satisfaction.

Tools and Techniques:
Power BI for data modeling and visualization.
Measures like attrition rate and employee counts to provide actionable insights.
Page Navigator feature for better report design.

Findings and Impact:
A detailed schema with six tables and nine relationships enabled efficient data exploration.
Attrition rate analysis highlighted key areas for improvement in retention strategies.
